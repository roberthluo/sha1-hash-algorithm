# sha1-hash-algorithm
This is a simple way learn about SHA-1 Hash algorithm. It was a main standard for a long time.
I am trying to learn the algorithm step by step from multiple guides.

# Why SHA1-hash-algorithm?
The algorithm is has been deprecated recently and google published about SHA-1 collision.
From my understanding, it is exploitable within a reasonable amount of time with high level GPUs and resources.


# It's avaliable in libraries, you can call it...
Yes, I agree. This is purely for learning only... and understand what folks talk about on hacker news. Maybe I wil learning about SHA-3 or SHA-256 next.
